## Summary for week 3
 * * *

### Roxane
* * *

I implemented a class for defining an activity and another one for defining a user.

My time estimate was a little too much, writing tests for my class was not so hard. So I try to improve my code coverage.

Next time, I'll try to pick a harder task, maybe in frontend, to learn more in android studio.

### Jean-Luc
* * *
I have implemented the home, login and registration pages

the estimated time was slightly higher than the real time but fortunately because many android studio bug slowed me down a lot.

Next time, I'll try to take a harder task because even if this one was very interesting, it lacked a bit of challenge

### Victor
* * *
My task was to implement a map view, fixed on some random location, and to let
the user access the map via a button on the home screen. Since it was pretty
straightforward how to make a MapsActivity using the google maps service, I 
decided to also implement a dynamic zoom on the user's GPS location. 

However, I underestimated the time it would take to resolve merge conflicts, and
since a merge was required to make the home screen button linked to the MapsActivity,
this couldn't be implemented this week although it is a very simple task.

Next time, I'll think about considering more time to spend on git and the pull requests
logistic rather than implementing more features than required.


## Kepler

I implemented a way to communicate with the Firestore backend to remotely manage instances of our Activity data structure.

The time estimate was accurate, as Anthony (who worked with me on basic Firebase integration) and I first had to understand the different services contained in the Firebase toolkit before figuring out a way to implement and test the functions we wanted.

Next time, Iâ€™d like to keep working on the backend aspect of the project, to clean up the code and have a more consistent interface.

### Mark
* * *

This week, I have implemented a class that provides a local cache for the logged users. I also linked it to the front-end activities of the app.

I have struggled a bit with Git (I had to rewrite my code due to a forced pull that overwrote my code) and the test coverage. I am planning to improve on that in the following weeks.

Next week, I will try to work on more granular tasks and choose time estimates more wisely.

### Anthony
This week, I have implemented two activities. The first one allows to register a user in Firebase. The second one is used to log a user in his account. Both activities retrieve data stored in Cloud Firestore.

Together with Kepler we linked Firebase with the app. The time taken to build those functionalities was more or less accurate. However, the time taken for creating tests and setting up pull-requests was a bit underestimated.

Next week, I will try to improve the activities I created and to orient my development procedure more in a TDD fashion.


### Overall team
* * *
We implemented almost all user stories in this sprint. This first sprint is for setting up a foundation of our app.

Our time estimates were too high for some coding parts, but we lost a lot of time in some tests and for understanding how to merge conflicts.

We did a standup meeting monday, it  was enough, and Kepler and Anthony worked together in Firebase.
